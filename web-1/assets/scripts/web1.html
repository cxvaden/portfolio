       <p> The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not 
	   the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is 
	   intended to be bried and small, but often the message is about a complex
	   relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of 
	   data.</p>
	
	   <p><a class="ex1"href="default.asp">This complexity can be made to appear clear and effective organization and presented and need not to be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does.</a></p>
   
       <p>Clarity refersto the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempthing to
       accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather
	   than the illumination of it. </p>
